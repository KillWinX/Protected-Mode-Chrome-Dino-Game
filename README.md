# Bootable Chrome Dino Game in C and Assembly 🎮

This is a **bootable version of the Chrome Dino Game**, built entirely from scratch using **C and Assembly** — with a little help from our favorite subject: **math!** 🧮  

The game features:  

- **Pixel-level graphics** and animations (moon, stars, RGB sphere).  
- **Physics and collision detection** for the dino and obstacles.  
- **Keyboard input handling** for jumping and easter egg activation.  
- **Easter eggs** — try reaching a score of **666** for a surprise!  
- Simple math for moving axes and object calculations — all done manually, no external libraries.
